# KMS Odin

> [wiki](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Odin)

If you don't account for cuteness or sex appeal, I'd consider Odin most interesting of them.
She has a very strong contrast to her artwork, hence the KMS color palette.
Her black color base, not showing skin, makes her white hair and the blood red accents stand out and
give her a manacing appearance worthy of a KMS Battlecruiser.

Her skirt seems to be made of shark scales which is a nice and fresh idea to show the KMS general shark related design.
This is a great adition to the established implementation of shark teeth, whole heads or fishbones used in most of the other KMS ships.
The design of her rigging is reminding me of Admiral Graf Spee, but is much more detailed.
Also her hair color, white with red accents is similar to AGS's but hers being long hair with braids is a nice alternative.

Her dark leggins are well made and give some less contrast by imlementing less detail then her remaining clothing.
This only emphasizes her boots further, her feet are rather slim, the boots are nice KMS boots with high heels and rudders, which are common for shipgirl art are a nice detail to see again.

Implementing two huge (I assume) blades, stored in the rigging has been there on other ships before, I appreciate this idea being implemented in a non IJN ship alot.
Her decorative elements, her coat and the officer's sword really get the spirit of a higher rank officer on the field.
The pose she is in is also adding to that picture, she appears to be ordering troops around. Her face seems very cold and calculative.

For the normal playerbase I assume her not to be very interesting since she does appear like the generic waifu material,
she does show nearly no skin and has not or not overly pronounced female curves (aside from her chestplate).
Her general body shape apprears to be quite normal, she is neither a loli nor a giant oppai oneesan.
The path of the middle, which some of the battlecruisers, light cruisers and light aircraft carriers follow, is my personal favourite.

All together a great picture and work of art.
