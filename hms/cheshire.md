Cheshire adds a little moe and spice to the set of HMS vanguard ships which most dominantly consists out of maids and service personal and combines this with decorative elements found on the HMS main line ships (which are mostly nobles), making her stand out of most of the other HMS ships, there are exceptions but none fits in the same way they also stand out as her.

Her pose and facial expression are very lively and energetic, somewhat individual, kind of a fresh wind to the royal navy.
Most other maids appear very formally and well behaved, she has something I'd almost consider cheeky to her appearance.

As for her clothing she swaps aroound the normal maid color scheme
(dark blue grey as base with white aprons and puffy shoulderpads).
Utilizing a white color base with a dark blue/purple-ish black accent color.
Her head decor with reminds of cat ears which, for the royal navy, is something rare to find and is very nicely crafted with ribbons that also have decorative elements and nice detail in their fabric.
Her collar and tie element are again more of a symbol of nobelty in direct contrast to the frilled part on her shoulders, being more a maid-like design element.

Her sleeves are very interesting and lovely to see, since they are seperate elements with cut-outs that are tied together and smoll ribbons on the frilled end after the puffy part.
The decorative belts and ribbons on her ellbow and wrist are very nice to look at and add to her general dynamic.
Her wrist decoration emphasizes her hands and fingers quite a lot and the pointy edges are a nice contrast to the frills used for very frequently.

The middle to lower part of her outfit looks nice and interesting, it does a good job emphasizing her curves without forcing the focus on these while also implementing the decorative elements, such as goldren threads and lines and frills.
Her skirt is very interesting, the front is short and the back is long, it's illustrated motion is a huge aspect of they artworks dynamic.
The fact that it's fabric is not see through is also nice and left the artist the chance to focus on shading and lighting which turned out very nicely.

Her thigh high socks are lovely and doing well emphasizing her thighs, they are white which is definitely the nicest color for thigh high socks in Azur Lane artwork, them being just a little translucent makes them very nice and appealing.
They do not squish her flesh overly as many other ships with thigh highs suffer from and are are attached with little belts so they don't move down, ribbons, lace and frills while also reimplementing the golden decoration makes them fit well in the design.

(I have already been writing a lot but there are many details, so I feel like I have to)

Her hair is quite shiny and nothing too special, her streight pony is suiting her,
as well as her short hair which again is rather rare for shipgirls,
accounting for the super high detailed clothing, long hair might have been a little too much,
implementing blue streaks that are the same color of the eyes and nails is nice and satisfying to see come back in many different parts of her.
Also the blue gives a nice contrast to the pink accents on her rigging and the effects around her.
Those choices make her appear quite individual and special, while also contributing to her lively appearance.

Her eyes are nice and fit well in the coloring and general art style.
Her cat shaped moush with the teeth, without further comment, is just moe.

Her body type is very nice fitting to her CA class and giving a good contrast to many of those overly thicc CAs.

All together a very nice character design and my personal favourite among PR3.
